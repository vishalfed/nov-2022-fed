----------------------------------
1) Desktop/Stand alone
2) Web Application
3) Mobile Application
4) Hybrid Application
5) Single Page Application

What is Enterprise?

Any business orgnization -> do business ->make a money

Why we develop the applications?
--------------------------------
To provide the services to the csutomers

Every enterprise application is divided into 4 layers

Layer ->Logical separation of code
Tier  -> Physical separation of code 


1.Presentation Layer -> 
   Code developed to provide the input screen and response    to the user

2.Service Layer -> It's a programtical implementation of              business rules

              if(source exisst & dest exists & amount <avaialable amount)
 {
  debit source account;
    credit destination account.
}


3.Data Access Layer :
      Code to access the data from database

4.Data Layer

       array
       txt,excel,xml
       RDBMS -MySQL,Oracle
       NOSQL -MongoDB
       another business application 

HTML -> Hyper Text Markup Language

Linear -> finite starting and linear progressing towars the end
             tape recorder,casset  
             
Hyper  -> you can slect item in fraction of second
          
             
MArkup Language
